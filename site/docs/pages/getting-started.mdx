# Getting Started

Depending on your project stack and state, there are multiple ways to get started with spanDEX.

# Existing Projects

See [installation instructions](/installation.mdx) for details on how to add spanDEX to your existing project. For react applications, see the [React getting started guide](/react/getting-started.mdx). Otherwise, see the [Core getting started guide](/core/getting-started.mdx).

# New Projects

We currently don't have a CLI available, but we're working on it! In the meantime, you can follow the instructions in the [Core getting started guide](/core/getting-started.mdx) to set up spanDEX in your project.
