# Configuration

Use configuration to tune how your meta-aggregator behaves in production: which providers are active,
how quote economics and optional integrator fee capture work, and what latency/retry behavior you
want globally.

## What You Can Configure

### Provider Mix

Choose one or more providers and define per-provider settings (keys, referral IDs, timeouts, negotiated
features, and more).

- [Provider strategy and comparison](/configuration/providers)
- [Provider-specific setup docs](/providers/fabric)

### Fees and Integrator Capture

Understand provider-imposed quote fees and configure optional integrator fee capture (swap fee and
surplus) for supported providers.

- [Fees and integrator fee capture](/configuration/fees)

### Runtime Controls

Tune global aggregation behavior in `options`:

- `deadlineMs`
- `numRetries`
- `initialRetryDelayMs`

### Execution Environment

Set clients, logging, or proxy mode depending on your app architecture:

- `clients` for simulation/validation support
- `logging` for info/debug/trace
- `proxy` when quote fetching runs server-side
