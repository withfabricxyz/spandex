# Onchain Simulation

## Overview

While fetched quotes provide a good estimate of swap costs, simulating a swap
can provide a more accurate picture of how the swap will perform when executed
onchain.

Simulation performs the swap and tracks state changes as if the transaction was executed onchain.
This allows us to:

- Confirm the accuracy of quotes by verifying that their quotes aren't stale or otherwise incorrect
- Include gas costs to compare real costs across different aggregators
- Verify swaps won't revert due to slippage, approvals, or insufficient balance

Additionally, there are edge cases such as contracts that have allowlists or other unexpected
behavior that can only be uncovered through simulation or a real transaction.

Ultimately, simulation allows us to compare quotes against their simulated onchain output, not just
quoted estimates.

## Configuration

> ⚠️ Some RPC providers do not support the underlying
[`eth_simulateV1`](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-apis/pull/484) method required for
simulation. Refer to your RPC provider's documentation to ensure that simulation is supported.

To enable onchain simulation, you'll need:

1. a viem `PublicClient` connected to the target chain
2. a `MetaAggregator` instance from the core SpanDEX package with your desired aggregators configured
