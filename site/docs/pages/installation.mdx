## Security Considerations

Given that spanDEX presents unsigned transaction data for execution, it's crucial have a security stance. Some recommended practices include:

* Lock or pin dependencies to specific versions to reduce supply chain attack risk.
* Use a package manager that supports integrity checks, such as npm or yarn, to verify the authenticity of packages.
* Require packages have a minimum age before updating, using pnpms minimumReleaseAge or similar features in other package managers.
* Ensure web apps have Content Security Policies (CSP) in place to mitigate risks from malicious scripts.
* Remember that supply chain attacks are real and the EVM is a ripe target.
