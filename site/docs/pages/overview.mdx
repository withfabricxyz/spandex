# Why SMAL

Before we dive into the specifics of SMAL, let's clarify some key concepts in the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem: DEX aggregators and meta aggregators.

## Why Aggregators?

Aggregators monitor liquidity across multiple decentralized exchanges (DEXes). The benefits are numerous:
- **Better Prices**: By pooling liquidity from various sources, aggregators can often find better prices for swaps than any single DEX could offer.
- **Reduced Slippage**: Aggregators can split trades across multiple DEXes to minimize slippage, resulting in more favorable execution prices.
- **Atomic Swaps**: Aggregators can facilitate complex trades that involve multiple tokens or routes, allowing users to swap tokens that may not have direct liquidity pools.

## Why Meta Aggregators?

Meta aggregators automate the process of querying multiple DEX aggregators. The advantages include:
- **Expanded Liquidity**: Not all aggregators cover the same DEXes or tokens. By using a meta aggregator, users can access a broader range of liquidity sources.
- **Optimal Pricing**: Meta aggregators can compare quotes from different aggregators to ensure users receive the best possible price for their swaps.
- **Redundancy**: If one aggregator is down or experiencing issues, a meta aggregator can fall back to other aggregators, ensuring continuous service.

## And SMAL?

SMAL is an open-source meta aggregator library provides all the benefits of a meta aggregator in a developer-friendly package without any middlemen. Benefits:
- **Open Source**: SMAL is fully open source, allowing developers to inspect, modify, and contribute to the codebase.
- **No Middlemen**: SMAL interacts directly with DEX aggregators, eliminating a centralized meta-aggregation service that could introduce latency, fees, censorship, or single points of failure.
- **Customizable**: Developers can choose which aggregators to include, configure settings, and extend functionality to suit their specific use cases.
- **Onchain Simulation**: SMAL supports onchain simulation of swaps, allowing developers to verify quote accuracy, gas costs, and potential reverts before executing transactions.

**The world is yours.**
