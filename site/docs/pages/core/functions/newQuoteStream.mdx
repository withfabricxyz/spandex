# newQuoteStream

Create a `ReadableStream` that emits serialized quotes as each promise resolves. This is useful for server-to-client streaming of quotes as they are fetched.

## Example

```ts
import { newQuoteStream, prepareQuotes } from "@spandex/core";
import { config, swap } from "./config.js";

export async function GET() {
  const promises = await prepareQuotes({
    config,
    swap,
    mapFn: async (quote) => quote,
  });

  return new Response(newQuoteStream(promises), {
    headers: {
      "Content-Type": "application/octet-stream",
    },
  });
}
```

## Params

### promises
`Array<Promise<Quote>>`

Quote promises to resolve and stream.

## Returns

`ReadableStream<Uint8Array>`

Stream of serialized quote frames.
