# Fees

spanDEX lets you request integrator fees and/or surplus sharing when fetching quotes. These settings
are **optimistic**: providers that do not support the requested fee features may still return
quotes.

Each successful quote can include `activatedFeatures`, which is the intersection of the requested
fee/surplus features and what the provider actually supports. Selection strategies other than
`fastest` prefer quotes with a higher count of activated features before applying the secondary
strategy (best price, lowest gas, etc). If no quote can activate the requested fee features, the
selection falls back to the usual strategy among all successful quotes.
