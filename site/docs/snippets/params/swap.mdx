## chainId
`number`

Chain identifier (EIP-155) where the swap will be executed.

## inputToken
`Address`

Address of the token being sold or supplied by the user.

## outputToken
`Address`

Address of the token being purchased or received by the user.

## mode
`"exactIn" | "targetOut"`

Swap mode:
- `"exactIn"`: The user specifies the exact amount of input token to sell.
- `"targetOut"`: The user specifies a target amount of output token to receive. This does not guarantee the exact output amount. Not all providers support this mode.

## inputAmount
`bigint`

Amount of input token to sell (denominated in base units). Required if `mode` is `"exactIn"`.

## outputAmount
`bigint`

Amount of output token to purchase (denominated in base units). Required if `mode` is `"targetOut"`.

## slippageBps
`number`

Allowed slippage for the swap, expressed in basis points (bps). For example, a value of `50` represents a maximum slippage of 0.5%. This parameter helps protect against price fluctuations between quote retrieval and transaction execution.

## swapperAccount
`Address`

Address of the account that will submit the swap transaction onchain. Some providers require this
for exclusive liquidity.

## recipientAccount
`Address | undefined`

Optional address that should receive output tokens. When omitted, output defaults to
`swapperAccount`.
