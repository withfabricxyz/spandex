# SpanDEX

One token swap library to rule them all. Query multiple DEX aggregators and find the best price without the added middleman tax.

Goals:
* Support multiple aggregators
* Expand tokens, pools, and chains beyond any single aggregator
* Provide redundancy when a provide fails
* Provide multiple quotes to find the best price
* No meta-aggregator fees
