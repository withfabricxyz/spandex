# SMAL

SMAL Meta Aggregator Library

One swap library to rule them all. Query multiple DEX aggregators and find the best price without the added middleman tax.

Goals:
* Support multiple aggregators
* Expand tokens, pools, and chains beyond any single aggregator
* Provide redundancy when a provide fails
* Provide multiple quotes to find the best price

### WIP!!!

TODO:
* Odos?
* 1inch?
* Approvals / permits
* Simulation
* Wagmi hooks


To install dependencies:

```bash
bun i
```

To run:

```bash
bun run index.ts
```

This project was created using `bun init` in bun v1.2.22. [Bun](https://bun.com) is a fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime.
